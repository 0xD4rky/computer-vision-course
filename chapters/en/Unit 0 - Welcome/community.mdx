# What is Discord?

Discord is a free chat platform. If youâ€™ve used Slack, youâ€™ll find it quite similar.  It is also not that different from WhatsApp Communities now. The Hugging Face Discord server is a home to a thriving community of 60 000+ AI experts, learners and enthusiasts that you can be a part of.

# Navigating Discord
Once you sign up to our Discord server, you'll need to pick the topics you're interested in by clicking `#Channels & Roles` at the top left. You can choose as many different categories as you like based on your interests but we recommend choosing "EVERYTHING!ðŸš€" so you get to see all the AI awesomeness happening inside the server. To find all the channels that are cited here go to "Browse Channels". Finally, Don't forget to tell us more about you on the `#introduce-yourself` channel.
