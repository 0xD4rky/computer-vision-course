# What is Discord?

Discord is a free chat platform. If youâ€™ve used Slack, youâ€™ll find it quite similar.  It is also not that different from WhatsApp Communities now. The Hugging Face Discord server is home to a thriving community of 60,000+ AI experts, learners, and enthusiasts.

# Navigating Discord
Once you sign up to our Discord server, you will need to pick the topics you are interested in by clicking `#Channels & Roles` at the top left. You can choose as many different categories as you like based on your interests but we recommend choosing "EVERYTHING!ðŸš€" so you get to see all the AI awesomeness happening inside the server. To find all the channels that are cited here go to "Browse Channels". Finally, Don't forget to tell us more about you on the `#introduce-yourself` channel.

# Computer Vision channels
There are many channels focused on various topics on our Discord server. You will find people discussing papers, organizing events, sharing their projects and ideas, brainstorming, and so much more.

As a computer vision course learner, you may find the following set of channels particularly relevant:

* `#computer-vision`: a catch-all channel for everything related to computer vision.
* `#cv-study-group`: a place to exchange ideas, ask questions about specific posts, and start discussions.
* `#3d`: a channel to discuss aspects of computer vision specific to 3D computer vision

If you are interested in generative AI, we also invite to join all channels related to the Diffusion Models:(#core-announcements, #discussions, @dev-discussions, and #diff-i-made-this)

Lastly, you can expand your horizons by joining related channels:
