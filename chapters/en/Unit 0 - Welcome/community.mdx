# Computer Vision Channels
There are many channels focused on various topics on our Discord server. You will find people discussing papers, organizing events, sharing their projects and ideas, brainstorming, and so much more.

As a computer vision course learner, you may find the following set of channels particularly relevant:

* `#computer-vision`: a catch-all channel for everything related to computer vision.
* `#cv-study-group`: a place to exchange ideas, ask questions about specific posts, and start discussions.
* `#3d`: a channel to discuss aspects of computer vision specific to 3D computer vision

If you are interested in generative AI, we also invite to join all channels related to the Diffusion Models: #core-announcements, #discussions, #dev-discussions, and #diff-i-made-this.
