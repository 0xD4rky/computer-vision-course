# Welcome


## Who are we?

This course was made for the community by the community. 

### Some context

It is not completly clear when this idea started and it might be burried deep into discussions on the HuggingFace server. However, on 26th of September, Adam(@lunarflu) tagged when Johannes Kolbe (@johko) on this course discord channel. From there, the syllabus started to take place and the github repo was created. Once we had the syllabus, the we divided ourself into teams to get to work! We craft chapters outline, gathered feedback. Then it was time to work, we wrote notebook, reviewed PRs. And after some time (and a late year sprint), the course came to life. Ta-dam!  This course is truly a labor of love and it would not be possible if it was not to a supportive and welcoming community.
