In this course, we will go from the very basics of computer vision all the way to some of the most recent advancements. The course is designed to touch on several foundation topics that cover the landscape of the field making computer vision what it is today.

Before beginning this course, it's recommended that you have some experience with Python programming and are familiar with transformers, machine learning, and neural networks. If these are new to you, consider reviewing the first unit of the Hugging Face NLP course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/3?fw=pt). While a strong knowledge of pre-processing techniques and mathematical operations like convolutions is beneficial, they are not prerequisites.

We are happy to have you here, let's get started!
