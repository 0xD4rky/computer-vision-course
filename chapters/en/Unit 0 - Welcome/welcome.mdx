# Welcome

Hi, welcome to the computer vision course!
We are happy to have you here. 

In this course, we will go from the very basics of computer vision all the way to some of the most recent advancements. The course is designed to touch on several foundation topics that cover the landscape of the field making computer vision what it is today.

## Who are we?

This course was made for the community by the community. 

### Context

It is not completely clear when this idea started and it might be buried deep into discussions on the HuggingFace server. However, on the 26th of September 2023, the discord channel for it was created. From there, we made a syllabus, and then a GitHub repo. We divided ourselves into teams and got to work! We crafted chapters outline, gathered feedback, wrote notebooks, and reviewed PRs. And after some time (and a late-year sprint) later, the course came to life. Ta-dam! 

This course is truly a labor of love and it would not be possible if it was not for a supportive and welcoming community. And you will see in the community chapter how to join us. 

Totalling, at least, 62 contributors. Here we give credit to everyone who helped make this course possible!
