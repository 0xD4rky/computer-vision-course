# Welcome to the Computer Vision Course

Dear learner,

Welcome to this course on computer vision. Whether it's unlocking your phone using facial identification, analyzing medical images to detect diseases, employing surveillance systems for public safety, monitoring wildlife, or generating new images, computer vision applications are adding tremendous value across a wide range of domains and Let's explore this world of computer vision together!

In this course, we will go from the very basics of computer vision all the way to some of the most recent advancements. The course is designed to touch on several foundation topics that cover the landscape of the field making computer vision what it is today.

Before starting this course, we recommend you already have some python programming experience and you are familiar with transformers and machine learning (including neural networks). If you are not familiar with it, take a look on the [first unit of the NLP course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/3?fw=pt). Having a good grasp of pre-processing techniques and knowing mathematical operations (such as convolutions) is helpful, but it is not a requirement.

We are happy to have you here, let's get started!
