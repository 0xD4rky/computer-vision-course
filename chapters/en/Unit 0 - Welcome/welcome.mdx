# Welcome to the Computer Vision Course

Dear Learner,

Welcome to the Hugging Face course on computer vision. Computer vision is revolutionizing our world in many ways, from unlocking phones with facial recognition to analyzing medical images for disease detection, enhancing public safety through surveillance systems, monitoring wildlife, and creating new images. Together, we'll dive into the fascinating world of computer vision!

In this course, we will go from the very basics of computer vision all the way to some of the most recent advancements. The course is designed to touch on several foundation topics that cover the landscape of the field making computer vision what it is today.

Before starting this course, we recommend you already have some python programming experience and you are familiar with transformers and machine learning (including neural networks). If you are not familiar with it, take a look on the [first unit of the NLP course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/3?fw=pt). Having a good grasp of pre-processing techniques and knowing mathematical operations (such as convolutions) is helpful, but it is not a requirement.

We are happy to have you here, let's get started!
