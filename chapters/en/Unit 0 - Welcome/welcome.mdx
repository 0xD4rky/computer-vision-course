# Welcome to the Computer Vision Course

Dear Learner,

Welcome to the community-driven course on computer vision. Computer vision is revolutionizing our world in many ways, from unlocking phones with facial recognition to analyzing medical images for disease detection, enhancing public safety through surveillance systems, monitoring wildlife, and creating new images. Together, we'll dive into the fascinating world of computer vision!

Throughout this course, we'll cover everything from the basics to the latest advancements in computer vision. It's structured to include various foundational topics, giving you a comprehensive understanding of what makes computer vision so impactful today.

Before beginning this course, make sure that you have some experience with Python programming and are familiar with transformers, machine learning, and neural networks. If these are new to you, consider reviewing the first unit of the Hugging Face NLP course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/3?fw=pt). While a strong knowledge of pre-processing techniques and mathematical operations like convolutions is beneficial, they are not prerequisites.

We are happy to have you here, let's get started!
