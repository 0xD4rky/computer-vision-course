Throughout this course, we'll cover everything from the basics to the latest advancements in computer vision. It's structured to include various foundational topics, giving you a comprehensive understanding of what makes computer vision so impactful today.

Before beginning this course, it's recommended that you have some experience with Python programming and are familiar with transformers, machine learning, and neural networks. If these are new to you, consider reviewing the first unit of the Hugging Face NLP course](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter1/3?fw=pt).
