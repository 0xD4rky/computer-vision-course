# Applications Of Computer Vision

In today's modern world, computer vision systems perform challenging tasks that are even difficult for humans to do. Consider India, a country with the highest number of registered two-wheelers in the world. Some people forget using a helmet here which can be dangerous and can cause severe injuries to the person; to address these issues, the Government of India, in collaboration with other institutions, developed  Computer Vision systems which can automatically catch riders without a helmet along with their licence plate to impose strict laws against them.

Computer Vision systems have numerous applications in Healthcare, Retail, Industries and many more. Here are a few high-level examples of computer vision systems:

## A high overview of computer vision system with examples

### Autonomous Vehicle

Self-driving cars heavily rely on computer vision to perceive and interpret the environment. They use cameras and sensors to identify objects, pedestrians, traffic signs, lane markings, and other vehicles on the road. Computer vision algorithms help these vehicles make real-time decisions, such as steering, accelerating, or braking, based on the analyzed data. Companies like Tesla, Waymo, and Uber are actively working on this technology to make transportation safer and more efficient.

### Retail and Ecommerce

Computer vision is revolutionizing the retail industry. Many online retailers and brick-and-mortar stores are using it for various purposes. One significant application fo this is the object recognition and recommendation systems. By analyzing images or videos of products, computer vision algorithms can identify items, understand their features, and recommend similar products to customers. For example, platforms like Amazon,eBay, Walmart use computer vision to suggest related products based on what a user is currently viewing or purchasing. Additionally, in physical stores, computer vision-powered systems can track inventory levels, detect stock shortages, and even analyze customer behavior to optimize store layouts and marketing strategies which can ultimately help them to enhance their stores.

## Quality control in assembly lines

CV in quality control on assembly lines helps in achieving higher accuracy, efficiency, and consistency in detecting and rectifying defects, thereby reducing waste, improving product quality, and streamlining manufacturing processes. There are many domains in which this is used some of them are:

**Defect detection**:  CV systems can analyze products on assembly lines in real time, identifying defects or irregularities that might not be immediately visible to the human eye. For instance, in manufacturing, CV can inspect items like electronic components, automotive parts, or packaged goods to spot imperfections, scratches, dents, or incorrect assembly. These systems compare the product against a standard reference to determine if it meets quality standards.
**Automated Inspection**: Traditional quality control often involves manual inspection, which is time-consuming and prone to human error. CV systems automate this process by using cameras and machine learning algorithms to capture images or videos of products as they move along the assembly line. These images are then analyzed to detect any deviations from the standard, ensuring consistency and high quality in mass production.
**Realtime Feedback and Maintenance system**: By integrating CV into assembly lines, manufacturers can receive real-time feedback about product quality. If a defect is detected, the system can trigger immediate actions, such as alerting a human operator, diverting the faulty product for rework, or even adjusting the machinery to correct the issue, minimizing the production of defective items and optimizing the overall production process.

## Medical Image Analysis

Medical image analysis involves the application of computer vision and machine learning techniques to interpret and extract information from medical images like X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, ultrasounds, and histopathology slides.

1. **Diagnostic Assistance**: Computer vision aids in diagnosing diseases and conditions by analyzing medical images. For instance, in radiology, algorithms can detect abnormalities such as tumors, fractures, or anomalies in X-rays or MRIs. These systems assist healthcare professionals by highlighting areas of concern or by providing quantitative data that helps in decision-making.
2. **Segmentation and Detection:**: Medical image analysis involves segmenting and detecting specific structures or anomalies within the images. This process helps in isolating organs, tissues, or pathologies for closer examination. For example, in cancer detection, computer vision algorithms can segment and analyze tumors from MRI or CT scans, assisting in treatment planning and monitoring.
3. **Treatment Planning and Monitoring**: Computer vision contributes to treatment planning by providing precise measurements, tracking changes over time, and assisting in surgical planning. It helps doctors understand the extent and progression of a disease, enabling them to plan and adjust treatment strategies accordingly.
4. **AI-Assisted Radiology**: AI-powered systems in radiology assist radiologists by automating routine tasks, reducing workload, and improving accuracy. These systems can flag potentially abnormal findings, provide quantitative analysis, and even predict potential health issues based on patterns identified in medical images.
5. **Drug Development and Research**:  In drug development and medical research, computer vision techniques assist in analyzing cellular structures, tissue samples, or genetic materials. This aids in understanding diseases at a microscopic level, contributing to the development of new drugs, therapies, or diagnostic tools.
