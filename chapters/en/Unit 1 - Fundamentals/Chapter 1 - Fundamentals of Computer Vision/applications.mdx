# A high overview of computer vision system with examples

In today's modern world computer vision is performing really difficult tasks which are even difficult for humans to do it. For example driving a 2 wheeler without helmet is a really difficult dangerous and can cause severe injuries to the person, now non helmet vehicle is a really tidious task as a human, this where computer vision comes into picture, it is an efficient approach to use object detection in detecting the non helemet vehicles. It has numerous applications in the real world. Here are a couple of examples:

### Autonomous Vehicle

Self-driving cars heavily rely on computer vision to perceive and interpret the environment. They use cameras and sensors to identify objects, pedestrians, traffic signs, lane markings, and other vehicles on the road. Computer vision algorithms help these vehicles make real-time decisions, such as steering, accelerating, or braking, based on the analyzed data. Companies like Tesla, Waymo, and Uber are actively working on this technology to make transportation safer and more efficient.

### Retail and Ecommerce

Computer vision is revolutionizing the retail industry. Many online retailers and brick-and-mortar stores are using it for various purposes. One significant application fo this is the object recognition and recommendation systems. By analyzing images or videos of products, computer vision algorithms can identify items, understand their features, and recommend similar products to customers. For example, platforms like Amazon,eBay, Walmart use computer vision to suggest related products based on what a user is currently viewing or purchasing. Additionally, in physical stores, computer vision-powered systems can track inventory levels, detect stock shortages, and even analyze customer behavior to optimize store layouts and marketing strategies which can ultimately help them to enhance their stores.

## Quality control in assembly lines

CV in quality control on assembly lines helps in achieving higher accuracy, efficiency, and consistency in detecting and rectifying defects, thereby reducing waste, improving product quality, and streamlining manufacturing processes. There are many domains in which this is used some of them are:

**Defect detection**:  CV systems can analyze products on assembly lines in real time, identifying defects or irregularities that might not be immediately visible to the human eye. For instance, in manufacturing, CV can inspect items like electronic components, automotive parts, or packaged goods to spot imperfections, scratches, dents, or incorrect assembly. These systems compare the product against a standard reference to determine if it meets quality standards.
**Automated Inspection**: Traditional quality control often involves manual inspection, which is time-consuming and prone to human error. CV systems automate this process by using cameras and machine learning algorithms to capture images or videos of products as they move along the assembly line. These images are then analyzed to detect any deviations from the standard, ensuring consistency and high quality in mass production.
**Realtime Feadback and Maintanance system**: By integrating CV into assembly lines, manufacturers can receive real-time feedback about product quality. If a defect is detected, the system can trigger immediate actions, such as alerting a human operator, diverting the faulty product for rework, or even adjusting the machinery to correct the issue, minimizing the production of defective items and optimizing the overall production process.

## Medical Image Analysis

Medical image analysis involves the application of computer vision and machine learning techniques to interpret and extract information from medical images like X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, ultrasounds, and histopathology slides.

1. **Diagnostic Assistance**: Computer vision aids in diagnosing diseases and conditions by analyzing medical images. For instance, in radiology, algorithms can detect abnormalities such as tumors, fractures, or anomalies in X-rays or MRIs. These systems assist healthcare professionals by highlighting areas of concern or by providing quantitative data that helps in decision-making.
2. **Segmentation and Detection:**: Medical image analysis involves segmenting and detecting specific structures or anomalies within the images. This process helps in isolating organs, tissues, or pathologies for closer examination. For example, in cancer detection, computer vision algorithms can segment and analyze tumors from MRI or CT scans, assisting in treatment planning and monitoring.
3. **Treatment Planning and Monitoring**: Computer vision contributes to treatment planning by providing precise measurements, tracking changes over time, and assisting in surgical planning. It helps doctors understand the extent and progression of a disease, enabling them to plan and adjust treatment strategies accordingly.
4. **AI-Assisted Radiology**: AI-powered systems in radiology assist radiologists by automating routine tasks, reducing workload, and improving accuracy. These systems can flag potentially abnormal findings, provide quantitative analysis, and even predict potential health issues based on patterns identified in medical images.
5. **Drug Development and Research**:  In drug development and medical research, computer vision techniques assist in analyzing cellular structures, tissue samples, or genetic materials. This aids in understanding diseases at a microscopic level, contributing to the development of new drugs, therapies, or diagnostic tools.

### Variability-

The data that is collected from the real world is extremely varied. - There are differences in the lighting, viewpoint, occlusions, and backgrounds. This makes it difficult to develop computer vision systems that are reliable.

### Scalability-

Computer vision systems need to be scalable in order to manage large datasets and meet real-time processing requirements.- This is necessary because the amount of visual data continues to increase

### Accuracy-

The achievement of a high level of accuracy in object detection, scene interpretation, and tracking continues to be a major problem, particularly when it comes to scenes that are either complicated or cluttered.- This is due to noise in the dataset, irrelevent features and bad quality of images.

### Robustness to noise-

Data collected from the real world are notoriously noisy, and they frequently contain defects, artefacts from sensors, and distortions. - Computer vision systems need to be able to withstand this kind of noise.

### Interactions with other technologies-

The combination of computer vision with other technologies, such as natural language processing, robotics, or augmented reality, presents difficult challenges linked to the interoperability of the systems involved.- This also expands the usabiliy of machine learning and computer vision in real world.&#x20;

### Privacy and ethical concerns-

Concerns of privacy and ethics arise up when real-world applications of computer vision are considered, in particular when it comes to situations involving surveillance, facial recognition, and the gathering of data.- There should be a proper system for handling the database for such models involving image or any other personal information of people without human intervention.

### Real time Processing-

A number of applications, such as autonomous vehicles and augmented reality, demand processing in real time or with a low latency, which presents hurdles in terms of the amount of computational efficiency that can be achieved.-  For handling these type of application huge computational power is required with a capable cloud platform.
