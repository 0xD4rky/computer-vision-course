# Introduction

General intro saying that massive amounts of training data are needed to train computer vision models. It isn't always possible / practical to obtain real data. This is where synthetic data comes in.

## What is Synthetic Data?

Synthetic data is artificially generated on a computer to augment or replace real data to improve AI models, protect sensitive data, and mitigate bias. Ideally, the synthetic data should have the same statistical properties as the real-world data it is supplementing.

## Why Would You Use Synthetic Data?

- Ethics/privacy issues(faces)/regulatory constraints
- Lack of availability of data (medical images, less common traffic signs, emergency vehicles, endangered animals)
- Expense/practicality of annotating real life data/time constraints
