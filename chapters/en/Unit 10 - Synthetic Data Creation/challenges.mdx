# Challenges and Pitfalls Associated With Using Synthetic Data

In this unit, we have learned how to generate synthetic data using several different methods.
Before using synthetic data to train a model, however, there are several important things you should consider.

## Does the Dataset Adequately Reflect Real World Data?

One challenge is that synthetic data might not adequately represent the complexity
and diversity of the real-world data. It's like trying to paint a picture of a forest using only
a few colors – you might capture some aspects, but it won't be as rich as the real thing.

## Is there overfitting?

Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data so well that it doesn't perform well on new, unseen data.
It's akin to learning a specific way to solve a math problem but realizing that it doesn't work for all types of problems.
If the process of generating synthetic data is too simple or their are overly consistent patterns, your model might overfit to the limited variations
present in the synthetic data. For example, if you trained a model on the following synthetic
dataset of 25 circles and 25 squares it will probably learn to associate circles with the color red and squares with the color blue. If you
trained an object classifier using this dataset it would likely fail if presented with a red square.

## Are there problems data quality?

Let's consider our the lung images we generated using DCGAN. While some of the images looked pretty realistic, others were not
so good. A model trained with the low-quality images might fail to detect pneumonia because they contain noise that isn't present in the real images.
Your model might also get really good at recognizing patterns in the synthetic data, but those patterns might not exist
or may be different in the real world.

## Are there biases in the synthetic data?

If the process of generating synthetic data has biases or inaccuracies, your model may unintentionally
learn and perpetuate those biases. Beware of the following pitfalls:

_Limited Diversity:_
If your synthetic data doesn't include a wide variety of people, places, or objects, your computer might
not fully grasp the diversity of the real world. It's like studying only one chapter of a history book and missing
out on the richness of different cultures and experiences.

_Copying Existing Biases:_
If the data you used to create the synthetic images already had biases, your the model might unintentionally
learn and replicate those biases. It's like copying a friend's notes without realizing they made a mistake
– your computer might end up with the same misunderstandings.

## Does the benefits of using synthetic data outweight the computational cost?

Generating high-quality synthetic data can be computationally expensive. This may pose challenges in terms
of both time and resources, especially for complex models or large datasets.

## Concluding Remarks

Even after training your model, it's crucial to continuously monitor its performance in real-world scenarios.
If your model encounters new situations or trends that weren't present in the synthetic data, it might struggle to adapt.
Addressing these challenges involves thoughtful design of the synthetic data generation process, careful evaluation
of the model's performance on real data, and ongoing efforts to enhance the model's robustness and fairness.
