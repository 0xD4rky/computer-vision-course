# Synthetic Data Generation Using Deep Generative Models

We will (probably) demo the use of GANs to generate data to improve classification accuracy for the detection of disease using medical imaging.

- liver (tumors)
- brain imaging (tumors / Alzheimers)
- lungs (pneumonia)
- eyes (glaucoma)

These repos have code we can probably adapt to demo medical image data generation:
