# Final Thoughts

Conclusion discussing ways to evaluate synthetic image data using the following critera.

Useful Resource: the [MedSynAnalyzer](https://github.com/ayanglab/MedSynAnalyzer) repo proposes a set of tools for anaylzing the quality of synthetic medical images.

### Fidelity

- Does the synthetic dataset reflect the real distribution?
- FID / Inception Score

### Variety

- How well does the data capture the variety and complexity of real world data?
- mode collapse (mentioned in conjuction with GAN models)

### Utility

- How useful is the model that is trained on the synthetic data? Are predictions accurate?

### Privacy

- Membership Inference
- Domains where privacy is especially relevant: medical research (Alzheimers)
