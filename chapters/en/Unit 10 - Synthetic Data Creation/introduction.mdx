# Introduction
Have you ever tried to get hold of some data for your problem, be it a Machine Learning problem or some other development related problem and 
you just couldn't find enough data. Either the data is not available or it is closed source and not available to you. How to deal with such a situation?

Well, one solution is synthetic data. Synthetic data is generated by a model to be used either in-place of real data or together with real data. Here, by model, we don't mean only Machine or Deep Learning models, they can be
simple mathematical or statistical models also, like a set of (stochastic) differential equations modeling a physical or economic [system](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-56436-4). Feeling excited yet? Let's dive more
into the details of synthetic data, what they are, how they are generated, and why are their benefits. You might be able to answer the last one a little by now ;)

## What is Synthetic Data?

As [Royal Society](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03257) defines it, Synthetic data is data that has been generated using a purpose-built mathematical model or algorithm, with the aim of solving a (set of) data
science task(s). Keep in mind that synthetic data only mimics the real data
and are not generated by real events. Ideally, the synthetic data should have the same statistical properties as the real data it is supplementing. It has many uses such as improving AI models, protecting sensitive data, and mitigating bias.

## Why Would You Use Synthetic Data?

Before answering this question, let's talk a little bit about why real data is not sufficient anymore. Some of the non-exhaustive problems with real data are:
- It can be messy and very hard to deal with.
- Inter-company data sharing might not be possible due to privacy issues.
- Medical data is confidential and hence cannot be shared openly.
- It can be biased.
- Expensive data collection and annotation.

Most of the above mentioned problems can be easily solved by synthetic data:
- Synthetic data are generated in a structured form and hence they are easy to deal with.
- Companies can train synthetic data generation models which learn the distribution of the original data but doesn't reveal 
anything about the original data and hence maintains the privacy. Similar approach can be taken for medical data.
- We can train the data generator model to generate de-biased data.
- Synthetic data can be augmented with real data to make the models or applications more robust.


## How to generate synthetic data?

Here, we mention some of the ways to generate synthetic data:

- CAD & Blender: allows creation of photorealistic image datasets of 3d scenes while controlling parameters. It enables computing metrics by comparing the synthesized data to the ground truth (generation parameters). It is a very robust method but limited in generation quality, diversity and quantity. Use cases include using [commercial applications](https://amazon-berkeley-objects.s3.amazonaws.com/static_html/ABO_CVPR2022.pdf), generating [synthetic faces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.15102), and [monitoring wildlife](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Mu_Learning_From_Synthetic_Animals_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf).

- Deep generative models (Transformers/GANs/Diffusion models): allows expanding a dataset, tackle data imbalance, and solve privacy issues. Very convenient and powerful but can create datasets with biases, incoherence, and repetitiveness, which induces an important overtraining risk and produces a restricted set of predictions. Use cases include [medical image generation](https://rdcu.be/dokei), [efficient plant disease identification](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/12/10/2395), [industrial waste sorting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14828), [traffic sign recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04927), and
