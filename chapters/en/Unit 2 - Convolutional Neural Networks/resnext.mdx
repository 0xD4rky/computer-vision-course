# Resnext

## Introduction

The architecture Resnext is one of the latest non-vision transformer based architectures which had a very good performance in terms of accuracy and computational complexity. This architecture merged the concept of branching-off convolution from the Inception model and residual network together. In other words , we can think Inception + Resnet = ResNext!
The paper is refered in [1]

## Contributions

- Significant improvement to the performance on the Classification and Object detection tasks compared to Resnet.
- Significant improvement to the computational complexity.
