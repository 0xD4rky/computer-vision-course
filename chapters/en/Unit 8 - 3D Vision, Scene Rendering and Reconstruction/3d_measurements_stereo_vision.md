# Introduction
This section explains how stereo vision works and how it can be used to find the 3 dimensional structure of surrounding objects. Stereo vision means capturing 2 or more images of the same scene from different locations and/or viewpoints. Images could be captured by using 2 or more cameras, or by moving the same camera.

# Problem statement 
Let's understand the problem statement of finding the 3D structure of objects by understanding the geometry of image formation. As shown in figure 1, we have a point P in 3D with x,y,z coordinates. Point P gets projected to the camera's image plane via the pinhole. This can also be viewed as projecting a 3D point to a 2D image plane. 

Now, let's say we are given this 2D image and location of the pixel coordinates of point P in this image. We would like to find the 3D coordinates of point P. Is this possible ? Is point P unique or are there other 3D points which also map to the same pixel coordinates as point P ? Answer is all 3D points which lie on the line joining point P and the pinhole will map to the same pixel coordinates in the 2D image plane. 

For finding the 3D structure of objects, this is the problem we are trying to solve. For our problem statement we can view an object in 3D as a collection of 3D points. Finding the 3D coordinates of each of these points helps us determine the 3D structure of the object.
