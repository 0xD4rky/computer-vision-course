# YOLO 

## A short introduction to Object Detection

Convolutional Neural Networks has taken a big step towards the image classifcation problem. But there remains
another big task to solve. Object detection. Object detection not only requires to categorize the object from the image but also to accurately predict the location (in this case the co-ordinates of the bounding boxes of the object) from the image. Here came the big breakthrough of YOLO. Before delving into the depth of YOLO, lets get through the history of object detection algorithms using CNN._createMdxContent
