# Overview of the previous SOTA models


### General trend:

The success of deep learning, particularly CNNs trained on massive datasets like ImageNet,  revolutionized image recognition. This trend continues in video processing. However, video data introduces another dimension compared to static images: time. This simple change introduced a new set of challenges that CNN trained in static images were not built to deal with. 

# Previous SOTA models in Video Processing

## Two-Stream Network(2014):

This paper extended deep Convolution Networks(ConvNets) to perform action-recognition in video data. 

The proposed architecture is called Two-Stream Network. It uses two separate pathways within a neural network:

- **Spatial Stream:** A standard 2D CNN processes individual frames to capture appearance information.
- **Temporal Stream:** A 2D CNN, or another network, that processes several frame sequences (optical flow) to capture motion information.
- **Fusion:** The outputs from both streams are then combined to leverage both appearance and motion cues for tasks like action recognition.


## 3D ResNets(2017):

Standard 3D CNNs extend the concept to capture spatial and temporal information simultaneously using 3D kernels (2D spatial information + temporal information). A downfall of this model is that the large number of parameters of the 3D CNNs makes it slower than 2D CNNs. Therefore, 3D CNNs typically are relatively shallow compared to the architecture of 2D CNNs. 

In this paper, they applied the architecture of ResNets to 3D CNNs. This model introduces deeper models for the 3D CNNs and achieves a lower loss value.

## (2+1)D ResNets(2017):

</div>

(2+1)D ResNets is inspired by 3D ResNets. Howver, a key difference is how the layers are structured. This architecture introduces a combination of 2D convolution and 1D convolution:

- 2D convolution capture spatial features within a frame.
- 1D convolution capture motion information across consecutive frames.

This model can learn spatiotemporal features directly from video data, potentially leading to better performance in video analysis tasks like action recognition.

- Benefits:
    - The addition of nonlinear rectification (ReLU) between two operations doubles the number of non-linearities compared to a network using full 3D convolution for the same number of parameters, thus rendering the model capable of representing more complex functions.
    - Decomposition facilitates the optimization, yielding in practice both a lower training loss and a lower testing loss.

# Current Research

Currently, researchers are exploring deeper 3D CNN architectures. Another promising approach is combining 3D CNNs with other techniques like attention mechanisms. Alongside that, there is a push for developing larger video datasets like Kinetics.

[Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/) is a free and open resource that provides access to research papers in the field of machine learning, along with the code implementations of the methods and algorithms described in these papers. One of its key features is the ability to see the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models for various machine learning tasks and benchmarks. This makes it an invaluable tool for researchers and practitioners who want to stay updated with the latest advancements and implement cutting-edge models.

# Conclusion

The evolution of video analysis models has been fascinating to witness. These models were heavily influenced by other models which once were the state-of-the-art. For example, Two-StreamNets motivated by ConvNets and (2+1)D ResNets inspired by 3D ResNets. As research progresses, one can expect even more advanced architectures and techniques to emerge in the future.
