### Part 1. Fundamentals of Computer Vision
	
 
Almost every being on the earth has some way to sense light. Even some bacteria and single-celled organisms have some simple ways to detect it.  Humans are not any different. We use our eyes to give us information about the world. The images formed in our retina are what we use as input to make decisions. We are so used to this process that on a day-to-day basis, we donâ€™t realize how much we use our brains to understand the world. 

If you ever unexpectedly kicked a ball, your unconscious brain performed several tasks in a split second. It was able to correctly identify the ball, track its movement, predict its trajectory, calculate the speed at which the ball would arrive at your location, predict your foot trajectory, adjust the strength and angle of impact, and send the signal from your brain to your foot to adjust its trajectory. It is the process of taking an image (in this case, the signal that is received by our retina) and transforming it into information (kicking the ball) that is at the core of computer vision.

In more general terms, computer vision tries to extract meaningful information from images. This is a really hard task because computers have no previous knowledge of the world. In our example, we start knowing what a ball is, how to track its movement, how objects usually move in space, how to estimate when the ball will reach us, where is your foot, how a foot moves, and how to estimate how much force you need to hit the ball. We take our understanding of the world for granted, but for our computers, images are just a bunch of related numbers.

Albeit they have similar input and output, human vision and computer vision are different processes. Sometimes they might have some overlap, just like how some branches of artificial intelligence and human cognition do. However, computer vision is primarily concerned with the development of algorithms and models in artificial vision systems and the decisions they make. It is not defined by its similarity to human vision. Due to its nature, computer vision can be more accurate and faster than its human counterparts. Thus, it is used for problems that would be too tedious, time-consuming, expensive, or error-prone for humans to do.

As a field, computer vision has a growing importance in society. There are many ethical considerations regarding its applications. For example, a model that is deployed to detect cancer can have terrible consequences if it classifies a cancer sample as healthy. Surveillance technology, such as models that are capable of tracking people, also raises a lot of privacy concerns. This will be discussed in more detail in chapter 14- Applications of computer vision and real-world use cases.
