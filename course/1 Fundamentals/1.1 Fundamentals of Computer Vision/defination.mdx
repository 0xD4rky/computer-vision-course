Pursuing the visual world is a bit of a puzzle. Let's revisit kicking a ball
we discussed in the previous chapter, which involves spotting it, working out the
best way to kick it and other miniature details to complete the task. But guess what?
Our brains can do it fast and effortlessly because of years of evolving and improving it.
That's the essence of computer vision, enabling computers to see and understand the world as
we do and make smart choices.

Human Vision and Computer Vision models have a lot in common; in fact, much of the research in computer vision
is conducted by studying human vision. However, they also have key differences. One of the most significant
distinctions is that human vision systems can learn and adapt in a way that computer vision systems cannot.
While current computer vision systems are remarkable in mimicking human vision, they lack adaptive and learning
capabilities that make human vision so versatile. Bridging this gap is a fascinating challenge for researchers
and an area of active exploration within the field.

In the upcoming chapters, you'll delve deeper into some of the renowned computer vision architectures,
some of which are influenced by studying human vision. But for now, let's understand what computer vision is.

## What Is Computer Vision?

Computer Vision is a multi-disciplinary field of Artificial intelligence(AI) and Computer Science
that enables computer systems to analyze, interpret and process visual information, which we humans
do using our visual system. It involves the development of algorithms, models and systems that can
extract knowledge from images, videos and other forms of visual data.

Computer Vision analyses data constantly until it finds patterns to recognize images, which involves
Image Acquisition, Preprocessing, Feature Extraction, Pattern Reorganization, etc. Computer Vision models
must be trained on massive amounts of data for the most accurate outputs.

## Deep learning and the computer vision renaissance

// I'll add a paragraph explaining DL & CNN here //

The evolution of computer vision has been marked by a series of incremental advancements in and across
its inter-disciplinary fields, where each step forward gave rise to breakthrough algorithms, hardware
and data, giving it more power and flexibility. Researchers, engineers and passionate hobbyists across
the world are actively building innovative models from the scientific discipline of computer vision's
theory and keeping them in practice; with Open-source initiatives, community-driven projects and sharing
the knowledge and code with others, we are witnessing democratizing access to cutting-edge tools and
technologies which is pushing the boundaries of what's achievable.
