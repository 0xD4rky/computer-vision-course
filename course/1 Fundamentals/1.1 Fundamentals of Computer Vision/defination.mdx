## Short recap

Let's revisit our example from the previous chapter: kicking a ball. As we have seen, this involves multiple tasks that our brains are capable of doing in a split second. The extraction of what is meaningful information from an image input is at the core of computer vision. But what precisely is computer vision?

## What is Computer Vision

Computer Vision is a multi-disciplinary field of Artificial intelligence (AI)  
that enables computer systems to analyze, interpret, and process visual information. It involves the development of algorithms, models, and systems that can extract knowledge from images, videos, and other forms of visual data.


## Deep learning and the computer vision renaissance


The evolution of computer vision has been marked by a series of incremental advancements in and across its interdisciplinary fields, where each step forward gave rise to breakthrough algorithms, hardware, and data, giving it more power and flexibility. One such history was the jump to the widespread use of deep learning methods.

 Initially, to extract and learn the information in an image you extract features through image-preprocessing techniques (chapter 3). Once you have a group of features describing your image, you use a classical machine learning algorithm for your dataset of features. It is a strategy that already simplifies things from the hard-code rules, but it still relies on domain knowledge and exhaustive feature engineering. The competing strategy arises when deep learning methods and large datasets meet each other.  DL allowed machines to automatically learn complex features from the raw data. This paradigm shift allowed us to build more adaptive and sophisticated models causing a renaissance in the field.

We wanted to recognize here that the compute vision community is made up of researchers, engineers, data scientists, and passionate hobbyists across the globe coming from a vast array of disciplines. This community maintains the Open-source initiates, leads community-driven projects, and democratizes access to cutting-edge tools and technologies.

##  Distinction between human and computer vision systems
 
I feel like this definition is already clear from the first chapter and I am not sure this fits here anymore.

## Interdisciplinary with other fields + Image Understandin

  
Just as it is hard to draw a line that separates artificial intelligence and computer vision, it is also hard to separate computer vision from its neighboring fields. Take image preprocessing and analysis, as an example. A tentative separation is that the input and output of image analysis are always an image. However, this is a myopic take. Even simple tasks, such as calculating the medium value of an image, would be classified under computer vision. To clarify their differences, we must introduce a new concept of image understanding. 

 Image understanding is the process of making sense of the content of an image. It can be defined in three different levels : 

Low-level processes are primitive operations on images (i.e. image sharpening, changing the contrast). The input and the output are images.
Mid-level processes include segmentation, description of objects, and object classification. The input is an image, but the output is attributes associated with the image. This could be done with a combination of image pre-processing and ML algorithms.

High-level processes include making sense of the entirety of an image, i.e. recognition of a given object, and scene reconstruction, image-to-text. These are tasks typically associated with human cognition.

Image analysis is mostly concerned with low and mid-level processes. However, computer vision is interested in mid- and high-level processes. Thus, there is an overlap in the mid-level processes between image analysis and computer vision. 

It is important to keep this in mind since for data-poor scenarios or simple images, it might not be appropriate to allocate resources for the development of a fancier model such as a neuronal network. From a business point of view, model development costs time and money, it is necessary to know when to use the right tools.  

It is also not unusual to combine a “pre-processing” part before moving on to a more robust model. Or, on the opposite side, sometimes, the layers of a neural network automatically perform tasks like these, eliminating the need for explicit pre-processing. For those familiar with data science, image analysis might act as a first exploratory data analysis step. Lastly, classical image analysis methods can also be used for data augmentation to improve the quality and diversity of training data for computer vision models. 

### Nice to have

## Computer Vision Tasks Overview

We have seen before that this is a really hard task because computers have no previous knowledge of the world. In our example, we start knowing what a ball is, how to track its movement, how objects usually move in space, how to estimate when the ball will reach us, where is your foot, how a foot moves, and how to estimate how much force you need to hit the ball. If we were to break this down into specific computer vision tasks, we would have:

  - Scene Recognition 
  - Object Recognition
  - Object Detection
  - Segmentation (instance, semantic)
  - Tracking 
  - Dynamic Environment Adaptation
  - Path Planning

You will see more about the core tasks of computer vision in the [CV TASKS] chapter.
But there are many more tasks that computer vision can do! Here is a non-exhaustive list:

  - Image Captioning
  - Image Classification
  - Image Description
  - Anomaly Detection
  - Image Generation
  - Image Restoration
  - Autonomous Exploration
  - Localization

#TODO : add links to specific chapters that discuss some of these tasks


# Task Complexity

The complexity of a given task in the realm of image analysis and computer vision is not solely determined by how noble or difficult a question or task may seem to an informed audience. Instead, it primarily hinges on the properties of the image or data being analyzed. Take, for example, the task of identifying a pedestrian in an image. To a human observer, this might appear straightforward and relatively simple, as we are adept at recognizing people. However, from a computational perspective, the complexity of this task can vary significantly based on factors such as lighting conditions, the presence of occlusions, the resolution of the image, and the quality of the camera. In low-light conditions or with pixelated images, even the seemingly basic task of pedestrian detection can become exceedingly complex for computer vision algorithms, requiring advanced image enhancement and machine learning techniques. Therefore, the challenge in image analysis and computer vision often lies not in the inherent nobility of a task, but in the intricacies of the visual data and the computational methods required to extract meaningful insights from it.


## Link to computer vision applications

As a field, computer vision has a growing importance in society. There are many ethical considerations regarding its applications. For example, a model that is deployed to detect cancer can have terrible consequences if it classifies a cancer sample as healthy. Surveillance technology, such as models that are capable of tracking people, also raises a lot of privacy concerns. This will be discussed in detail in Chapter 14- Applications of Computer Vision and real-world Use Cases, but we will give you a taste of some of its application
