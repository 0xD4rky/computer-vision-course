# Introduction to Computer Vision

Every organism on earth, even the tiniest bacteria and single-celled organisms,
can sense light, and humans have evolved a more complex and sophisticated way of
perceiving the world around them, thanks to their remarkable visual system. The
images captured by our eyes get processed by our brains almost instantaneously,
which guides us in our day-to-day activities without our conscious awareness.

Consider the act of kicking a ball on a football field; in a split second, your brain manages
to recognize the ball, track its motion, predict its trajectory, calculate the speed at which
the ball reaches you, adjust the strength and angle of impact and transmits the signal to your
foot to ensure the ball was kicked with precision. The process of taking an image (the visual
input received by our retina) and transforming it into meaningful information (the action of kicking the ball)
lies at the heart of the computer vision field.

Computer Vision tries to extract meaningful information from visual data. Still, this task
presents significant challenges to computers because they need more knowledge of the world than
humans. However, the research and development happening in and around its neighbouring fields gives
computers new capabilities.

## What is Computer Vision?

Computer Vision is a multi-disciplinary field of Artificial intelligence(AI) and Computer Science
that enables computer systems to analyze, interpret and process visual information, which we humans
do using our visual system. It involves the development of algorithms, models and systems that can
extract knowledge from images, videos and other forms of visual data.

The evolution of computer vision has been marked by a series of incremental advancements in and across
its inter-disciplinary fields, where each step forward gave rise to breakthrough algorithms, hardware
and data, giving it more power and flexibility. Researchers, engineers and passionate hobbyists across
the world are actively building innovative models from the scientific discipline of computer vision's
theory and keeping them in practice; with Open-source initiatives, community-driven projects and sharing
the knowledge and code with others, we are witnessing democratizing access to cutting-edge tools and
technologies which is pushing the boundaries of what's achievable.
