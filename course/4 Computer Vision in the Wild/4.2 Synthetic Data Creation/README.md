# Introduction

## What is Synthetic Data?

Synthetic data is artificially generated on a computer to augment or replace real data to improve AI models, protect sensitive data, and mitigate bias. Ideally, the synthetic data should have the same statistical properties as the real-world data it is supplementing.

## Why Would You Use Synthetic Data?

- Ethics/privacy issues(faces)/regulatory constraints
- Lack of availability of data (medical images, less common traffic signs, emergency vehicles, endangered animals)
- Expense/practicality of annotating real life data/time constraints

## Approaches to Generating Synthetic Data

- CAD & Blender : allows to create photorealistic image datasets of 3d scenes while controlling parameters. Allows to compute metrics by comparing to the ground truth (generation parameters). Very robust method but limited in generation quality/diversity/quantity

- Use cases include using [commercial applications](https://amazon-berkeley-objects.s3.amazonaws.com/static_html/ABO_CVPR2022.pdf), generating [synthetic faces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.15102), and [monitoring wildlife](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Mu_Learning_From_Synthetic_Animals_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf).

- Deep generative models (Transformers/GANs/Diffusion models): allows to expend a dataset, balance it, solve privacy issues... Very conveniant and powerfull but can create datasets with biases, incoherence and repetitiveness which induces an important overtraining risk and produce a restricted set of predictions

- Use cases include [medical image generation](https://rdcu.be/dokei), [efficient plant disease identification](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/12/10/2395), [industrial waste sorting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14828), [traffic sign recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04927), and [de- tection of emergency vehicles for an autonomous driving car application](https://computer-vision-in-the-wild.github.io/eccv-2022/static/eccv2022/camera_ready/ECCV_2022_cvinw_Domain_Compatible_Synthetic_Data_Generation.pdf).

Synthetic Animals

[Learning from Synthetic Animals](https://github.com/JitengMu/Learning-from-Synthetic-Animals)

- Motivation: monitoring wild animal behaviours, developing biologically inspired robots, motion capture systems
- Approach: Use synthetic CAD model and generate pseudo-labels on real images

### Medical Imaging

Motivation: Labeling is very expensive in medical imaging but rare cases are very important (to study rare illnesses) -> Synthetic data enables the creation of a more balanced dataset

### Challenges

### Domain shift

### Circular use of synthetic data generation

This is already a problem for LLMs as transfer learning datasets are often partially generated by other LLLMs (see [artificial artificial artificial intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07899)). Increases the dataset's biases and restricts the set of predictions
